Node merge
----------

If a parent node has low activity levels, it will merge in the child node
with the lowest load.

Low activity means the node has fewer than 2k objects and no callout lag.

Nodes are not eligible to be merged unless they are at least one hour old
and have been underloaded for at least 5 minutes.

Nodes cannot absorb more than one node every 15 minutes.
