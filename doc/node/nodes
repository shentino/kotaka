Node system
-----------

Every node corresponds to an object in the game universe.

Object distribution
-------------------

Every object that exists has a home node.

- An object can be present on more than one node at a time for read access
- An object can only be present on one node for write access

Connections
-----------

A node retains connections to its parent node

Global backup
-------------

Hierarchial object accounting
-----------------------------

Every object will keep aggregate counts of the number of objects
contained inside, not counting objects diverted to subnodes.

When an object leaves or enters another, the second object will have an
audit event scheduled.  Within a random period of time between 0.5 and
1.5 seconds, it will count up all objects inside itself and signal an
audit to its parent if said parent does not already have an audit
pending.  Thus, totals will percolate up the hierarchy.
