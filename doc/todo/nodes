Node system
-----------

Every node corresponds to an object in the game universe.

Object distribution
-------------------

Every object that exists has a home node.

- An object can be present on more than one node at a time for read access
- An object can only be present on one node for write access

Connections
-----------

A node retains connections to its parent node

Global backup
-------------

Hierarchial object accounting
-----------------------------

Every object will keep aggregate counts of the number of objects
contained inside, not counting objects diverted to subnodes.

When an object leaves or enters another, the second object will have an
audit event scheduled.  Within a random period of time between 0.5 and
1.5 seconds, it will count up all objects inside itself and signal an
audit to its parent if said parent does not already have an audit
pending.  Thus, totals will percolate up the hierarchy.

Node activity
-------------

Node activity is indicated with the worst of:

* Object count

	- Under 2k objects is considered low load

	- Over 100k objects is considered high load

* System load

	- Measured by lag of 1.0 second callouts

	- Every time an instrumentation callout expires, the total lag of
	that callout is added to the accumulated lag, minus 0.05 seconds.

	- Total accumlated lag of over 1.0 seconds flags the node as
	under high load and will cause the node to be split.

Node split
----------

An object with high load will be split as follows:

* Take the sub-object with the greatest load

* Keep going down until further descent would reduce the portion below
half

* Take the last object found and split it into a new node.

* When the new node connects, have it ingest all the objects inside the
object picked as the split point.

Node merge
----------

If a parent node has low activity levels, it will merge in the child node
with the lowest load.

Low activity means the node has fewer than 2k objects and no callout lag.

Nodes are not eligible to be merged unless they are at least one hour old
and have been underloaded for at least 5 minutes.

Nodes cannot absorb more than one node every 15 minutes.
