Ways to reference an object
---------------------------

(work in progress)

First, absolute references:

* Absolute object name

This is the DGD wise name of the object

Example:  /kernel/sys/driver

* Catalog name

References an item in the object catalog.

Example: characters:shentino:spyro

Ways to modify an object reference:

* Containment via local id

An absolute object name, specified either by catalog name or absolute
name, can be further qualified with a sequence of local IDs that lead
downward thorugh containment.

Appending a semicolon and a local ID causes the reference to move from
the object to the contained object with that local ID.  Further steps
down the hierarchy can be made with further appendings.

You can also go UP by using the reserved ID of ENV.

Example: characters:shentino:spyro;satchel;gem
