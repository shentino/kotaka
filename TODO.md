## Deprecate implicit module registration

In the future, the existence of a module's InitD will no longer
be the official indication of the module's being online.

### 0.61

Usage of the module's initd's existence as an indication
of the module's status will be formally deprecated.

Going forward, ModuleD should be explicitly queried
regarding a module's state.

ModuleD's interface for booting and shutting down modules
should be used exclusively.

A module can be nuked even if it's shut down to enforce a
complete purge of its owned objects.

### 0.62

ModuleD's record on the status of a particular module
will no longer automatically reflect the status of the
module's initd.

Modules will only be sent signals by ModuleD if they are
officially online according to ModuleD's records.

A module registered as online, but whose initd is not
compiled, will be an anomalous state that will generate a
runtime error.  Such a detected status will cause the
defunct module's missing initd to be deprived of signals.
