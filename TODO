Master TODO
===========

This is the master, active TODO list for kotaka development.

Anything here is on the front burner to get done in the foreseeable future.

Tasks should be listed in order of desired completion.

Pending
-------

Archetypes

	Introduce new archetype api, formally deprecate old one
	Formal deprecation of constructors and destructors

Ban system upgrade

	The banning system needs to be upgraded

	* Auditing of who issues a ban

	* Temporary bans that expire

	* Automatic bans by code

	Bans should be turned into a mapping.

	Key:

		Each ban can be listed by a key.

		The canonical form of a key is an IP address followed by a CIDR mask.

	Value:

		The value should itself be a mapping with the following keys:

		expire: The expiration date
		issuer: Who issued the ban
		message: Message shown to the banned user
		note: Administrative notes

Property hardcoding

	Some properties really should be hard coded as they are an
	intrinsic part of an object.

	Such hard coded properties should, relatedly, be listable as hard
	coded and immune to configuration by PropertyD.
