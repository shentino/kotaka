===========

This is the master, active TODO list for kotaka development.

Anything here is on the front burner to get done in the foreseeable future.

Tasks should be listed in order of desired completion.

Pending
-------

Archetypes

	Introduce new archetype api, formally deprecate old one
	Formal deprecation of constructors and destructors

Ban system upgrade

	The banning system needs to be upgraded

	* Auditing of who issues a ban

	* Temporary bans that expire

	* Automatic bans by code

Change logging

	Log spamming is a potential denial of service vector.

	We need a way to flush logs

Remove System dependency on Bigstruct

	As a matter of principle System itself must not have any
	dependencies on external code.

Obsolete code

	ObjectD

		The old upgrade chain needs removed.

		For now, we're shifting obj->upgrade calls to SUSPENDD.

	PatchD

		We need to remove the old code for handling patches.
