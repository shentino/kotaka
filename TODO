Master TODO
===========

This is the master, active TODO list for kotaka development.

Anything here is on the front burner to get done in the foreseeable future.

Tasks should be listed in order of desired completion.

Pending
-------

Archetypes

	Introduce new archetype api, formally deprecate old one
	Formal deprecation of constructors and destructors

Ban system upgrade

	The banning system needs to be upgraded

	* Auditing of who issues a ban

	* Temporary bans that expire

	* Automatic bans by code

Change logging

	Log spamming is a potential denial of service vector.

	We need a way to flush logs

Obstructed
----------

Remove PatchD

	This no longer will have a use in the future.  So we need to
	remember to have it removed after the old api is gone.
