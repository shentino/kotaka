Reduce archetypes
-----------------

It's simpler if each object only has one archetype.

When an object is converted to only one archetype, we pick its first one.

* Reduce archetype system so that an object can have only a single archetype

	- By default, an object's archetype will be the first of its archetypes

	- When an object's archetype list is collapsed, its archetype will be
	conformed as well
