How to upgrade your mud
-----------------------

Every upgrade has the following sequence of events:

1.  upgrade kotaka

	Use the upgrade command to start the upgrade process.

	This command is responsible for taking care of all of kotaka's
	native code.

2.  obsolete & stale

	Check for any objects that need to be recompiled because of
	changed inherits or includes.

3.  rebuild

	For a quick method to rebuild everything, use the rebuild
	command.

4.  prepare for changes

	If there are any API changes in kotaka, they will be announced
	at least one version in advance.

	Kotaka will (or at least should) be able to handle BOTH api's at
	the same time until the old one has been deprecated and removed.

Current API changes pending
---------------------------

Rename in the toucher/patcher API

	It's been found that using call_touch is useful in areas besides
	object upgrading, so a few changes have been made:

	First, "toucher" has been renamed to "patcher" to reflect its
	true purpose, and objects marked with call_touch manually will
	retain their touched status.

	Second, due to untraceable data corruption found to be provoked by
	previous code, it has been decided that a clean rebuild of the
	program database will be required.

	To prepare for this, please:

	1.  Make sure all existing objects are accounted for, either by a
	corresponding LPC source file or otherwise noted.

	2.  Run the system upgrade to cause the program database to be
	wiped.

	3.  Reset the object database with oreset.
