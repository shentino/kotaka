How to upgrade your mud
-----------------------

Every upgrade has the following sequence of events:

1.  advanced notice

	Any API changes will be announced at least one version in advance.

	For the purposes of this section, a change means anything that
	will cause the old API to be unusable.

	Unless otherwise noted, until the old API is obsoleted, it will
	remain valid to use both APIs at the same time, though warnings
	may be issued if the old API is used.

2.  preparation

	If anything needs done to prepare for an upgrade, those
	instructions will be provided, and should be completed before the
	actual upgrade.

3.  upgrade

	Use the upgrade command to start the upgrade process.

	This command is responsible for taking care of all of kotaka's
	native code.

4.  post upgrade work

	Instructions may be provided for things needing to be done after
	the upgrade is completed.

5.  recompiling (optional)

	It is advisable to keep all objects up to date with reference to
	their source code and inherits.

	Anything that depends on a source or header file that has been
	changed, or inherits a library that has been recompiled, should
	be recompiled as well.

Current API changes pending
---------------------------

Deprecation of multiple archetypes

	To avoid exponential complexity in a few areas, as well as encourage
	neater data inheritance, multiple archetypes are deprecated.

	They will be forbidden in the future, and later forcibly removed.

	To prepare for this change any object with multiple archetypes
	should be reworked.

Deprecation of constructors and destructors

	I just realized that inheritables can be added and removed from
	an object's inheritance tree at will by anyone with access to the
	object's source code.

	They are therefore completely useless.
