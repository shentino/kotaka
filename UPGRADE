How to upgrade your mud
-----------------------

Every upgrade has the following sequence of events:

1.  advanced notice

	Any API changes will be announced at least one version in advance.

	Unless otherwise noted, until the old API is obsoleted, it will
	remain valid to use both APIs at the same time, though warnings
	may be issued if the old API is used.

2.  preparation

	If anything needs done to prepare for an upgrade, those
	instructions will be provided, and should be completed before the
	actual upgrade.

3.  upgrade

	Use the upgrade command to start the upgrade process.

	This command is responsible for taking care of all of kotaka's
	native code.

4.  post upgrade work

	Instructions may be provided for things needing to be done after
	the upgrade is completed.

5.  recompiling (optional)

	It is advisable to keep all objects up to date with reference to
	their source code and inherits.

	Anything that depends on a source or header file that has been
	changed, or inherits a library that has been recompiled, should
	be recompiled as well.

Current API changes pending
---------------------------

Deprecation of multiple archetypes

	To avoid exponential complexity in a few areas, as well as encourage
	neater data inheritance, multiple archetypes are deprecated.

	They will be forcibly removed in the future.

	To prepare for this change any object with multiple archetypes
	should be reworked.

Rename in the toucher/patcher API, data corruption fix

	It's been found that using call_touch is useful in areas besides
	object upgrading, so a few changes have been made:

	First, "toucher" has been renamed to "patcher" to reflect its
	true purpose, and objects marked with call_touch manually will
	retain their touched status.

	Second, due to untraceable data corruption found to be provoked by
	previous code, it has been decided that a clean rebuild of the
	program database will be required.

	To prepare for this, please:

	1.  Make sure all existing objects are accounted for, either by a
	corresponding LPC source file or otherwise noted.

	2.  Run the system upgrade to cause the program database to be
	wiped.

	3.  Reset the object database with oreset.
