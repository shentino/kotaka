How to upgrade your mud
-----------------------

Every upgrade has the following sequence of events:

1.  upgrade kotaka

	Use the upgrade command to start the upgrade process.

	This command is responsible for taking care of all of kotaka's
	native code.

2.  obsolete & stale

	Check for any objects that need to be recompiled because of
	changed inherits or includes.

3.  rebuild

	For a quick method to rebuild everything, use the rebuild
	command.

4.  prepare for changes

	If there are any API changes in kotaka, they will be announced
	at least one version in advance.

	Kotaka will (or at least should) be able to handle BOTH api's at
	the same time until the old one has been deprecated and removed.
