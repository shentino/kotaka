How to handle upgrades as a developer of Kotaka
-----------------------------------------------

Upgrading an end user's MUD is a required at times operation.

Minimizing disruption of the end user's code is paramount.

General principles is, that each module's InitD is responsible first
checking and then enforcing the upgrades for all of the code in its
module.

Principles:

1.  System is special

It is the heart of the system and holds rule over the other modules in
the library, therefore it must be treated specially.

Current upgrade procedure:

1.  Recompile INITD

	The INITD is the heart of the System module and also has a fixed
	API that it must adhere to with the kernel library.

2.  Have the upgraded INITD
