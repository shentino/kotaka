Updates since 0.45:

Features:

* It is now possible to treat Ecru (aka, anything outside of a /home
directory) as its own module.  The "initd" for the module is /initd.

Internal:

* ObjectD was slimmed down a bit and some functions not relevant to
serving hooks for the kernel library were relocated to SubD.

* LogD now keeps its file buffers in a linked list rather than wasting
a program for a special LWO.

Fixes:

* Callouts are no longer redirected in ustates if
triggered by the master object

* Rebooting the Text module
