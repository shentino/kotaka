To upgrade kotaka:

1.  Unpack the new version of kotaka in such a way that the new version
of kotaka takes the place of the old one.  It should be wiped completely.

2.  In the mud, recompile System, as well as everything that depends on it.

*** IMPORTANT ***

Do NOT re-run install.  Doing that will wipe your mud out.
