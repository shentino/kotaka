Naturally, I hope my mudlib works and is bug free, but I can't program
in peace if I have to worry about a lawsuit everytime I screw up.

So, here goes...

First, in legalese...

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranties of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR OTHERWISE AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY PARTY WHATSOEVER BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY,
EITHER OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, FOR DAMAGES, CONSEQUENTIAL,
DIRECT, PUNITIVE OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM THE USE OR POSSESSION OF
THIS MUDLIB, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH LIABILITY OR DAMAGES.

Second, in plain English...

This mudlib is just for fun.  All it's meant to do is amuse and
entertain.  Use at your own risk, ESPECIALLY if you use it for a purpose
not listed in the previous sentence.

See the file COPYING for full information on other disclaimers of
warranty.
