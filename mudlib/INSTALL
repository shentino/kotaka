Installing Kotaka:

1.  Required Reading

Read LICENSE, then WARRANTY.  The first contains your legal rights to
use and/or modify Kotaka.  The second emphasizes that kotaka is a toy,
not a tool.

2.  Preparation of DGD

Get DGD, latest version you can snag.

	Sourceforge project: dgd-osr

Compile it.

	If you wish to use >2G swapfiles, -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

	You may need to insert a "INET6=0" define into the makefile.
	
	If you wish to precompile the klib for performance reasons, do
	so at this stage, but make sure you do the following:
	
		a. Use kotaka's mud/include/config.h, not the default
		one included with the klib.

3.  Preparation of Kotaka

4.  Preparation of your mud

If you wish to use the supplied "ulario" test mud, follow its directions.
Otherwise, get busy writing your own mud, and put your files in ~Game.

5.  Have fun!

Once your mud is set up, with either the test module or your own thing
running on top of kotaka, you're on your own.

Notes:

The install script works by creating a fresh, empty directory, then
filling it with a skeleton of directories, and finally populating the
skeleton with symlinks to both dgd and kotaka.
