1.  compile ~Geometry/initd.c
2.  freeze the mud (csuspend and cblock)
3.  destruct ~Geometry/lib/thing/position
4.  destruct ~Geometry/lib/thing/geometry
5.  reinherit ~Geometry/lib/thing/geometry
6.  touchall for any downstream users of ~Geometry/lib/thing/geometry (probably ~Game/obj/thing)
7.  unfreeze the mud (crelease and cunblock)
