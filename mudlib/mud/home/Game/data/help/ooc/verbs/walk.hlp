Walk
----

Changes your position.

To walk, specify the path you wish to take.  The path is just a string of
n's, e's, s's, or w's, possibly with numbers in front, that say where to
go and how far.

All units are in meters.

Example

To walk 2 meters north:
> walk 2n
or
> walk nn

To walk 4 meters northeast:
> walk 4n4e
or
> walk nneeeenn
