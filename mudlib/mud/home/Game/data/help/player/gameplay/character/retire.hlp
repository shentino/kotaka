Character Retirement
--------------------

Your character is considered retired when his soul has been rendered
permanently unavailable.  It could be due to being destroyed, or retired
back into the essence of the creating deity.

On retirement, Invested XP is returned to your master pool.

If your character's soul is intact, your Earned XP is also added to your pool.

If it is destroyed however, all Earned XP is forfeited.
