I plan to allow different subsystems to register themselves.

Each subsystem is in charge of its own stuff.

Bootstrap

	Each subsystem has a file

InitD

	Each subsystem's initd is responsible for responding to queries


Authorization

In some cases, subsystems may need authorization from System to request
certain resources.  Limits on ticks spent during boot, or processing
callouts are examples, as well as usage of access proxies.
