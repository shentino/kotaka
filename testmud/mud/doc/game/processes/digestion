Tracking the biomechanical process in detail chews up (no pun intended)
lots of time, so it should only be done if it actually matters.  Since
the bulk (again, no pun intended) of this will happen outside the view
of any observers, it can be safely abbreviated.

General rule is that all objects are destructed when swallowed.

Exceptions:

1.  It is alive (!)

	Anything even remotely qualifying as "alive" by definition
	retains structural integrity.  Resolve it as combat with
	environmental effects (airless?  continuous chemical damage?)
	BEFORE dealing with digestion.  Besides, escape is possible!

	Additionally, anything that is alive also qualifies as an
	observer, and whether it is played by a user or an AI module it
	must be permitted to observe its senses.

2.  It cannot be digested

	Surgical extraction, regurgitation, and so on.

3.  It has side effects that take place after being ingested AND cannot
be properly simulated without the object remaining in existence.
