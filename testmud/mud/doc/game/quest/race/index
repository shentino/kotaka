Race quests are required quests that must be completed before you can
become a member of a particular race/species.

To become a member of a race, you need enough XP, and you must have
survived an encounter with a member of that race, and sometimes you must
complete a quest related to the race in question.

Typical quests involve encounters with creatures either above or below
the target race on the food chain, or perhaps, doing favors for that race.
