The divine hierarchy is structured loosely by species and location.

Yendor sits at the top.  He is the chief overdeity of all existence.  He
created the multiverse, and sits as chairman of the divine board, so to
speak.  He is too busy preserving "game balance" and "planar integrity"
to be much bothered with mortals directly.  Heck, even the lower level 

Yendor's chief concern is to make the multiverse stable for the benefit
of the created souls of his sub-deities.  Anyone who should threaten the
integrity of the multiverse itself, or of any of its planes, will draw
Yendor's wrath.

Yendor can only be played by admin.
