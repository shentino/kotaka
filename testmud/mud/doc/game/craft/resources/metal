Some ores may require high levels of heat to smelt.  A crucible/furnace
that isn't hot enough won't burn.  Crucibles require

A furnace can be operated manually by clever players, or skill checks
can put smelting on "autopilot".  A character with good skills will find
their players able to just sit back, whilst a character with BAD skills
