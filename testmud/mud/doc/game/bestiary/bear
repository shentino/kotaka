Bears, big and burly, brown, black, grizzly or polar.  They are berry
munching denizens of the forest.  They are however not the least bit
peaceful.  They are grouchy and aggressive.  If disturbed, they are
deadly.

Bears speak Ursine.  They understand the need for cohesiveness, but can
get belligerent if infringed on.
