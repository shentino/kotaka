Gray, white, or brown colored, the wolf is a feral beast.  Its cold
yellow eyes can strike fear into most any other smaller animal.

Wolves are pack hunting meat-eaters, and often work together to kill and
devour healthy portions of prey.  Their intelligence is uncanny, and
those out on a safari or other such adventure would do well to keep
their eyes peeled for these canines.  They are not evil, but can be
quite vicious if they are hungry.

Raised, or domesticated, they can also be loyal companions. In general
though, they should be avoided.

These beasts speak Canine with a thick forest accent.  They can be feral
and vicious, but can be minimally civil if they are spoken to in their
own language and respect is shown for their territory as well as their
pack structure.
