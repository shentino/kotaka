These big scaly beasts are truly the pinnacle of reptilian development. 
They are champions of the arts of combat and magic, and have a fine
culture to boot.

With tough scales, powerfully strong elemental breath, and strong wings
and claws, and teeth, they are more than a match for most other forms of
life.

Of particular perplexity is their convoluted digestive system and the
organs thereof.  Combining attributes from the snake, deer, and avian,
they are capable of consuming, digesting, and absorbing almost anything
they wish.  This helps them survive in the oddest of places, and also
makes them ideal as arena monsters, since there are no bones left to
bury.
