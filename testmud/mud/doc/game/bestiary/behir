Giant blue many legged beasts, possibly related to the dragons, but with
some serpentine ancestry too.

Much like mobile tanks, they wander around wherever they may live,
spending their lives among some culture, but mostly focusing on the bare
essentials of life, such as eating.

They have snakelike jaws, and can devour in single gulps any humanoid
sized creatures they run across...and often do if they're hungry or
angry.

They speak draconic.  They consider anything smaller than them as prey,
but those learning to communicate with them are viewed as worthy to
converse with as fellow creatures.
