These brown furred fleet of foot like to eat leaves and grass, and much
prefer to be in quiet.  They don't like to be bothered, and would rather
run than ask questions.

They can, however, serve as loyal companions and steeds if they are
raised from birth, or are otherwise treated gently and quietly and not
startled.  Such favored perception is difficult to gain, as deer do not
often give second chances.

Gentle social cues are the brunt of their language, and are much like
socialists in their groupings.  They may not have the brains or tongue
for flowery diplomacy, but they understand the bliss of a peaceful herd.

They are put in place as fodder for knives and fangs.
