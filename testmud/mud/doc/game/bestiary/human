Humans, one of the first races available to be chosen, are a classic
get-along-with-everyone kind of creature.  Civilized (by animal
standards anyway) and creative, they have ruled the earth ever since
they were created.

Their diets are quite inclusive, and have even been known to include
materials that many animals would shun as inedible.

Their culture runs the gamut.  Social customs vary, and sometimes are
contradictory.  They seem to value brains over brawn most of the time,
but the old fashioned brawl still decides many matters.
