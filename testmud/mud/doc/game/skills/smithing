The ability to make things out of metal is smithing.  You also need
smithing to be able to smelt ore.

You need good smithing skills to be able to make a sword.

White smithing is for soft metals.

Black smithing is for hard metals.

A bad smithing check can ruin the raw materials and turn it into scrap
grade junk.  Such scrap is only good for smelting.
