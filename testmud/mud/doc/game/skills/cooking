Self explaining

Meats tend to be relatively easy to cook.

Cooking checks can be used to both cook food and check the result of a
cooking check.

Cooking food entails a check.  The quality of the food depends on the
check.  A good check makes a pleasant meal, while a bad one can render
it unfit, unpalatable, or even inedible.  Bad cooking checks also mean
more burned food.
