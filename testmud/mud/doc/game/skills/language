Language skills allow you to listen to, speak, read, and write languages.

When you are exposed to a language you do not know, each word is treated thusly:

1.  Every time you are exposed to a word, you make an intelligence roll. 
Every point you make the roll by grants you a point in learning the
word.

2.  100 points per letter for a word and you learn it.

3.  Learn 1000 letters worth of words and you master the langauge
completely.

4.  Every word you don't learn is garbled

	a.  Length is changed from 0 to 50 percent shorter or longer by
	deletion of a letter or cloning and randomly inserting a random letter.
	
	b.  0 to 100 percent of the letters are changed randomly.
	
	c.  there is a 0 to 100 percent chance the word is evicted and inserted
	randomly.
