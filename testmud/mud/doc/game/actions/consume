Used when one object wishes to ingest and assimilate another or part as
food or drink in a biological sense.

This is intended to trigger a number of subactions in a continuous
process.

This is a semantic action that remains in progress so long as the actor
is consciously consuming something.  Once everything has been ingested,
the consume action stops by itself.  The actual assimilation process
falls under "digestion".  Thus, consume is a social and/or procedural
construct.

How exactly the object will be "consumed" depends on the creature doing
the consuming, and the object in question.

The consume action terminates with the "food" vanishing from view, most
likely winding up inside the actor's stomach if not outright being
destructed.

Only normal food and drink can be consumed.  Anything else must be
explicitly swallowed.
