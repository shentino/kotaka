Our TIMED is a nested queue.

We have a master queue that holds each future second's worth of objects
needing triggered, and each entry in this list is a sub queue of all the
objects scheduled to go off.

It's really ugly to insert or delete objects from the middle of the
queue, so I simply let objects "hole out".

For an object self destructing, it's easy.  The value in the queue shows
up as nil and we pass it over.

For an object removing itself, we note that an object can only be in the
queue once.
