Spatial indexing
----------------

Eventually I'll use R-trees, but for now I need something quick and
dirty that I don't need to study very hard.

Space tree:

A space tree is a layer of nodes between a spatial root and its physical
contents.

Basically, it's lazy octree.

Space root:

A space root is an object with spatially sensitive contents.

If needed, we divide it up into wedges, each wedge being a cube with one
of its corners at the origin.

All 8 cubes are of equal size, and the side length is the smallest power of two
required to cause all points to be contained.

If we ever need to insert an out of bounds object, we just repeatedly
expand the cubes to the next higher power of two until the inserted
point is engulfed.  Then we insert it into the covering cube.

Space node:

Standard octree style splitups.

How to resolve rectangles:

This setup is so far only good for points.
