Matter Energy Conservation

I consider matter and energy to be two entirely separate resources that
are separately conserved.  Proper usage of E=mc^2 would cause all sorts
of trouble with rounding and overflows owing to the sheer magnitude of
the energy involved.  Using units that allow for conventional management
as separate entities would greatly simplify things.

An insignificant amount of matter would create an overwhelming amount of
energy, and it would take an overwhelming amount of energy to create an
insignificant amount of matter.

Besides, converting between the two on any significant scale is
difficult enough to not worry about.

Nuclear fusion/fission?

Likely breaches futuristic prohibition.  I need to learn quantum physics
first anyway :P.

Matter/antimatter conversion?

Not even around in our time.

Matter is always matter, but energy can be either kinetic or potential.

If I can properly track gravitational potential energy.

I would like a motionless body under no influence from gravity to have
zero gravitational potential energy.  This means that if you're in a
gravitational field, you have negative potential energy that approaches
zero as you approach being infinitely distant from a gravitational
source.
