  <h1>Swallow Whole</h1>

  <h2>Standard</h2>

  <p>First off, the monster has to be at least 4 size categories larger.
  Then, make a Grab by +2.</p>

  <p>Target takes attacker's STR damage on that segment, then takes
  digestion damage every attacker's phase thereafter.</p>

  <p>Damage ranges from 1/2d6 K to 3d6 K, depending on how strong it
  is.</p>

  <p>Escape is possible with the right cutting weapon. Deal 1/2
  consumer's BODY to the stomach, which is at x1/2 DEF and 0 DCV.</p>

  <p>Capacity is at the discretion of the GM, as is the type of damage
  dealt.</p>

  <p>Strangely, this ability doesn't cost anything. I guess the caustic
  power of one's digestive juices is balanced out by being more vulnerable
  from the inside.</p>

  <h2>Shentified</h2>

  <p>Capacity is limited to the volumewise equivalent of 1 creature 3 size
  categories smaller than the consumer unless otherwise noted.</p>

  <p>Different creatures have different spreads of the kinds of damage
  they do. Most mammals have pretty soft stomachs, so they usually deal
  just acidic damage, whereas some of the larger reptiles carry sharp
  stones in their gizzards, dealing physical damage.</p>

  <p>Victim is considered to be in an airless environment unless otherwise
  noted. This causes 1 END per phase to be revoked.</p>

  <p>Getting your guts stabbed out from the inside isn't very pleasant.
  Swallowing whole should be considered mostly as a coup-de-grace or
  mop-up move for those species without strong stomachs. Usually, only
  large predators like dragons can use their stomachs as outright
  weapons.</p>

  <p>These rules apply while the victim is alive. Any object, including
  dead victims, are subject to the mechanics of digestion until
  assimilated, passed, or regurgitated.</p>
