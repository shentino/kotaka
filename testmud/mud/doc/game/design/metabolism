I use "BMR" as a shorthand for all the stuff that isn't accounted for by
express END usage.  800 Cal/day covers basic cell activity.  I boost it
up to 1200 to account for digestion, breathing, circulation, and casual
action that doesn't register as END usage.

Casual humans, that don't get tired, limit their END usage to what they
can recover.  This is 20 per minute, giving 28800 END per day used for
this.  Setting this to 800 calories leaves 1200 calories for BMR, and
this equals 43200 END per day on BMR, or 1 END per 2 seconds.  This
equates to 36 END per calorie.

Metabolic rate 2000 cal/day,

BMR in cal/day == 100 * (REC + BODY)
