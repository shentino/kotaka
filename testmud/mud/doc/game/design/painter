Painting
--------

Basically, painting is the process by which a scene is converted from a
collection of objects to an ascii graphic.

We basically use character cells as pixels.

When we render, we basically ask each object to draw itself on the canvas.

We tell it the coordinates it is located at and the scaling factor.

We are responsible for clipping.

Painter has a current pen, x, and y position.
