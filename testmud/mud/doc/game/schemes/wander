Wanderers wander randomly around.

Wanderers have a "roof" list.  They will not go through two way exits
that lead outside the roof.

Parameters:

roofs

	Any rooms a wanderer will voluntarily go into must be contained
	in one of the wanderer's roofs.

Options:

no-backtrack

	Means that the wanderer will not go through a 2 way exit if it
	just came through it.  Unless, of course, it went into a
	dead-end.

	Tends to cut down on skittishness to some degree.  I call it the
	"pac-man ghost" adjustment.
