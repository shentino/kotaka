Introduction

Welcome to Kotaka.  It's a mudlib by Shentino, and is based on
Phantasmal, with heavy inspiration from bits and pieces released by
Skotos.

If you're the top ranking admin who just installed this, then
congratulations on picking what will hopefully be a true diamond in the
rough.

Get creative, and make some interesting places for players to explore,
or hunt in.
