Botting
-------

Botting is defined as the usage of anything other than your own, hand
generated keystrokes to influence in any way whatsoever the behavior
and/or actions of any of your characters, those of other players, NPCs,
or the game world itself.

Botting, no matter how it is done, is forbidden.

At a minimum, any benefit you derived from botting will be revoked.
Additionally, you will receive exemplary consequences designed to deter you
from doing so in the future.
