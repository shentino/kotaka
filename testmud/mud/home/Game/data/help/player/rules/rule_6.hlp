No multiplay
------------

Barring advanced administrative approval, no player may use more than
one account, and no account may be used by more than one player.

We consider account sharing or duplication as a means of avoiding
accountability for one's actions, and we choose to forbid it explicitly.

The policy is one person per account.  Any exceptions to this policy may
be made only with the awareness and approval of an administrator.
