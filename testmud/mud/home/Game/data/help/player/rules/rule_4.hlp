Be nice

This is a primarily social arena.  As such, we value harmony.

Willfully being unkind, obnoxious, or rude to others, especially
newbies or staff members, is not allowed.

Griefing, which is defined as willfully or recklessly damaging anyone's
enjoyment of the game, is strictly prohibited, and carries stiff
penalties even for first time offenders.
