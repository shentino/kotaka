Keeping your self fed and hydrated
----------------------------------

Food and drink, two of the most vital parts of being a mortal.  The
deities have it so easy...

Anyway, this is pretty much self explanatory.  Eat when hungry, drink
when thirsty.  Hot climates or heavy labor will make you sweat more.

Getting hungry or thirsty will cause you to slow down by damaging your
energy, health, and mana recovery.
