Hall of Souls
-------------

This legendary building, located deep in the Holy Plane, is the hub of
the entire multiverse.

Deities from all worlds conduct their divine business here, most
ubiquitous of which is soul management.  This is where the life force of
every thing that breathes is created.

Yendor resides here, and in addition to being the almighty divine
administrator, serves as the source of infinite energy.
