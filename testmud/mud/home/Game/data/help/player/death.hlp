Death
-----

You're dead if your soul loses its grip on the body.

This will typically happen if you lose double your total BODY, or if
your soul gets torn from the body by certain magics or effects and can't
rejoin.

Good ways of staying alive include steering clear of dark magic and
keeping your health up.

If you're curious about the afterlife, reincarnation, or any of that
other "spirtual stuff", see religion.
