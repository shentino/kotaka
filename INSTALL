To use kotaka:

1.  Get DGD

	You can find dgd at git://github.com/dworkin/dgd

2.  Get the kernel library

	You can find the kernel library in one of two locations:

	git://github.com/dworkin/kernellib
	git://github.com/shentino/kernellib

	The shentino branch is preferred, but the dworkin branch should
	still work.

	Use the shentino branch if you want to keep track of callouts as
	a resource, or have runtime auditing of filequota

3.  Put the mudlib where you want it.

	The top level directory contains everything you need to run
	kotaka, except for the kernel library and dgd.

4.  Hook in the kernel library

	The kernel library has a /kernel directory and an /include/kernel
	directory, both of which are required to use kotaka.

	By default, symlinks to the kernel library and its include files
	are already in place that assume both kotaka and the kernel library
	are neighbors.

5.  Configure the kotaka.dgd file appropriately

	Make sure the directory setting points to the absolute path of
	where you installed kotaka.

6.  (optional) Set up the dgd-session script

	This script can be used to keep dgd going and will automatically
	restart it on termination if desired.

	If you'd rather start dgd manually, that is ok.

7.  (optional) Configure and enable Intermud

	You will need to examine ~Intermud/intermudd.c for correctness and to define MUDNAME.

	Once the file has been edited properly, check ~Game/initd.c and amend the load() function
	to boot the Intermud module.

8.  Connect

	By default, kotaka.dgd tells dgd to listen to the following ports:

	50000 Telnet login
	50001 Live status updates
	50010 Kernel library binary port emergency login

	Connect to port 50000, and select "register a new account"

	Then, pick the "admin" username.

9.  You are now ready.

	If you need more information, just read the in game help files.
