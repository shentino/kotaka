To use kotaka:

1.  Get DGD

	You can find dgd at git://github.com/dworkin/dgd

2.  Get the kernel library

	You can find the kernel library in one of two locations:

	git://github.com/dworkin/kernellib
	git://github.com/shentino/kernellib

	The shentino branch is preferred, but the dworkin branch should
	still work.

	Use the shentino branch if you want to keep track of callouts as
	a resource, or have runtime auditing of filequota

3.  Put the mudlib where you want it.

	The top level directory contains everything you need to run
	kotaka, except for the kernel library and dgd.

4.  Hook in the kernel library

	The kernel library has a /kernel directory and an /include/kernel
	directory, both of which are required to use kotaka.

5.  Configure the kotaka.dgd file appropriately

	Make sure the directory setting points to the absolute path of
	where you installed kotaka.

6.  (optional) Set up the dgd-session script

	This script can be used to keep dgd going and will automatically
	restart it on termination if desired.

7.  (or)  Start dgd

8.  Have fun
