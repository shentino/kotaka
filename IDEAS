Miscellaneous
-------------

Monitor mailbox

	Something in ~System that can leave messages for external scripts

	* Synchronization

		Making sure there's coordination between mudlib and script.

		Probably safe to assume renames are atomic

		Use the double handshake protocol

		* Sender raises request flag
		* Receiver raises grant flag
		* Sender puts data, raises sync flag
		* Receiver gets data, raises ack flag

	* Security

		This is easy, just stuff them in ~Secret/System somewhere
