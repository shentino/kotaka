Miscellaneous

Monitor mailbox

	Something in ~System that can leave messages for external scripts

	/home/Secret/System/inbound

		Messages to the mud from the host.

	/home/Secret/System/outbound

		Messages from the mud to the host.

	Writing:

		We write one message at a time, each message terminated
		by a newline.

		Since the file is opened, written, and closed, it will
		finish writing the message before closing the file.

	Reading:

		When content is detected, the file is renamed to have a
		.old suffix to atomically insulate it from further
		messages.

		If the file ends in a newline, then we know it is
		dormant.  If it doesn't then we know that the writer is
		still writing to it.

	* Synchronization

		Making sure there's coordination between mudlib and script.

		Probably safe to assume renames are atomic

		Use the double handshake protocol

		* Sender raises request flag
		* Receiver raises grant flag
		* Sender puts data, raises sync flag
		* Receiver gets data, raises ack flag

	* Security

		This is easy, just stuff them in ~Secret/System somewhere
